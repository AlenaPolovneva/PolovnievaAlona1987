                <h2>History of academic rowing</h2>
                In 1896, the first rowing club in Ukraine was created in Kamianskyi. 
                Starting from the 19th century, academic rowing developed most successfully in Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kamiansk and Odesa.

                In the USSR, the first championship in academic rowing took place in 1923, and in Ukraine in 1925 in the city of Mykolaiv. 
                G. Kyrychenko became the first Ukrainian champion of the USSR in 1938. 
            </p>
            <p>
                1952 at the European Championship G. Zhilin, I. Yemchuk and K. 
                Zemlyanska won the first gold medals in academic rowing.
            </p>
            <p> From 1950 competitions for the Cup of Ukraine are held, during which, since 1998, cups named after famous Ukrainian athletes and crews have been played.</p>
            <p> Currently, academic rowing in Ukraine is developing in Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Vinnytsia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kyiv regions and the city of Kyiv.  
                The Ukrainian national team participates in international competitions, in particular in the Olympic Games: men since 1952, and women since 1976.</p>
